# HestonOptionsPricer
A heston model implementation for pricing European options. I am starting with little to no experience/knowledge on how the Heston model works.
how 

My goals for this project:

Learn how the Heston model works and implement a basic version of it in py - DONE

Optimize/extend it to address limitations/"make it faster" - working on it/learning abt the limits of heston rn

Make plots

import real world data and see how it does compared to it.

Maybe - implement Black-Scholes to compare the models.
